BalloonController
=================

BalloonController is a flight computer data collection and logging system for a near-space balloon.

Description
===========

[HackPittsburgh](http://www.hackpittsburgh.org) has launched two high-altitude balloon projects.  
One was successful, one was not.  Our third launch is pending, and the payload is anticipated to 
include a number of sensors not previously flown.  This will require a controller that knows about
the layout of the flight computer circuit, the data to be logged, how to retrieve it, and how to log
it.

This software package contains that controller (which by extension includes the Arduino sketch's
`setup` and `loop` functions).  This package also includes libraries contributed by other 
HackPittsburgh participants to interface with the various flight computer subsystems.

Previous balloon launch photos are available at the 
[HackPittsburgh Flickr Pool](http://www.flickr.com/groups/hackpgh).  My favorites, plus my ground
photos, are in [My Flickr set](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jonspeicher/sets/72157624683638916/).

Minimum Requirements
====================

* An Arduino (http://arduino.cc)
* SparkFun Analog Mux Breakout (http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=9056)
* SparkFun 3-Axis Accelerometer (http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=9156)
* Adafruit Data Logging Shield (http://www.ladyada.net/make/logshield)
* Argent High-Altitude GPS (https://www.argentdata.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=144)
* Arduino 0021 (http://arduino.cc)
* SdFatLib 10-10-2010 (http://code.google.com/p/sdfatlib)
* Adafruit's fork of RTClib (http://github.com/adafruit/RTClib)
* NewSoftSerial 10c (http://arduiniana.org/libraries/newsoftserial)
* TinyGPS 9 (http://arduiniana.org/libraries/tinygps)

Installation
============

Refer to the installation instructions on the Arduino website to install the development 
environment.  To install the required libraries, assuming you are using a modern Arduino 
environment, simply unzip them to their own directories within:

    [your_sketchbook_directory]/libraries

There should be plenty of online documentation describing this process.

Usage
=====

To use BalloonController in your project, you must ensure that a few preprocessor definitions are
accurate, and you must of course wire up the proper circuit.  The best place to see what is required 
is in the code itself.  If you have any questions, email me.

Tests
=====

BalloonController is completely and utterly untested.  The code compiles, and that's all.  The
individual units upon which it relies have been tested, and I tried to be careful with the coding 
and design.  Nevertheless, I haven't actually *run* this thing, as hardware is not yet available.
For now, this project primarily serves as an integration point for the various dependencies.

Improvements
============

* The code could be made consistent from a naming and formatting standpoint
* Some interfaces return strings, others return ints/floats
* Some modules have initialization functions, some don't
* Encapsulation and packaging isn't the greatest
* An object-oriented solution might feel better
* And many, many, many more...
